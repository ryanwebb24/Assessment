// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning =
  "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";
const analysisOfRequirements =
  "Determine what is required for the product to be functioning. finding what is needed and neccessar";
const design =
  "you create a layout of how the application will look and function. using wire frames and even drawing out the looks and style of the app";
const implementation =
  "This is where the main block of code is written and the logic is added following the design already laid out";
const testingAndIntegration =
  "This is where we get the minimum viabele product and test to see that the key functions are working. you can also test other key features";
const maintain =
  "This is an ongoing process that is done to update code add new features and ensure there are no bugs";
